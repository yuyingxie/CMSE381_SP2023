For each date, we have recorded the percentage returns for each of the five previous trading days, `Lag1` through `Lag5`. We have also recorded `Volume` (the number of shares traded on the previous day, in billions), `Today` (the percentage return on the date in question) and `Direction` (whether the market was `Up` or `Down` on this date). Our goal is to predict `Direction` (a qualitative response) using the other features."
