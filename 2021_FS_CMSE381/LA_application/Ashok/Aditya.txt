Hello Professor,

I would like to volunteer to be a captain of a study group, the 'Dragon' study group 
( Dragon is my Chinese zodiac animal, I am born in 2000, year of the dragon).

I have attached my resume in this mail.

I have no prior experience as TA/LA for any class. However, I like taking up leadership roles that challenges to 
bring out the best in me. I have lead several teams: sports, academic, student council, conference manager etc. 
I will try developing an effective and inclusive learning environment by setting up strict fundamental rules against
 unprofessional language/behavior, plagiarism etc. in the slack (preferably discord) server.

Apart from that, I would like to share the motto 'A lesson learnt should be a lesson shared'.
 in this case this would mean that we are all in the same 'new' boat and are figuring out how to maneuver this class
 so if somebody understands something particularly well or comes across a resource that will be very
 helpful for a student's success in this course, I would encourage them to share it in the study group. 
We could set up weekly study hours where students can come, brainstorm, work on the homework or 
study for the exams together. Perhaps this platform for healthy networking could lead to new relationships 
and even interesting projects.

Best,
