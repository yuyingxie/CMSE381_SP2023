 Hi Professor Yuying,

I am definitely interested in becoming a study group captain and becoming one of the founding LAs for CMSE 381!
I am currently in my fourth semester as a LA for CMSE 201 where I have worked with several professors including 
last spring during the transition to online learning.  I know that my experience as a LA will be valuable in making
 this first class strong.

As far as my plan for creating an inclusive and effective environment, I would set up a slack channel where we can
 post questions to the study group, keep track of any questions that the study group cannot answer for each other,
 and be the liaison for my group to ask you and Ningyu for any assistance we need.  Additionally, I will schedule 
a time during the week that study group members can meet on zoom to work together on homework and studying. 
Finally, I will set up a collaborative study guide on google docs consisting of the questions you give us on 
homework and quizzes to ensure all members of my group are as prepared as possible. 

I am excited for this opportunity to make the most out of this class for myself and my fellow students.

Best,
Dylan
