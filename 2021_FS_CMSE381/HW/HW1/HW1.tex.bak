For the coding project, you can find the data on http://www.statlearning.com/resources-first-edition.  Please write your codes using Google style.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Exercise 2.4.7
	\item Exercise 2.4.8
	\item Load dat1.csv file from D2L, and write a Nearest neighbor prediction function in R to predict the values of $Y$ for $X = -1.9, -1.8, -1.7, \ldots, 1.8, 1.9$ with radius $r = 0.1$ or $0.3$ (namely, we define the neighborhood of a point $x$ as the interval $[x-r, x + r]$). Make a scatter plot of original data and the predicted results. Explain the difference between the two sets of result. Which one is more flexible?
	\item Exercise 2.4.10. you can find the data on http://www.statlearning.com/resources-first-edition.  Please write your codes using Google style.
	\item  What are the advantages and disadvantages of very flexible (vs less flexible) approach for regression or classification? When would be a more flexible approach preferable? What about a less-flexible approach?
	\item (Challenging problem, not required) Given nine data point in descending order $\{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_9\}$, prove that the best point, $a$, to represent these nine data with the smallest absolute error is the median of these nine data points, which is $x_5$ . Namely, $a$ minimizes 
	\begin{align*}
	   \sum_{i = 1}^{9}|x_i - a|
\end{align*}	  
	
\end{enumerate}
