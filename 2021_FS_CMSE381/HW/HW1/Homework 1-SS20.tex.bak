For the coding project, you can find the data on http://www.statlearning.com/resources-first-edition.  Please write your codes using Google style.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Exercise 2.4.7
	\item Exercise 2.4.8
	\item Exercise 2.4.10
	\item  What are the advantages and disadvantages of very flexible (vs less flexible) approach for regression or classification? When would be a more flexible approach preferable? What about a less-flexible approach?
	\item 	Given two continuous random variable $X$ and $Y$ with joint probability density $f_{X,Y}(x, y)$ and conditional probability density function of $Y$ given $X=x$ as $f_{Y|X}(y, x)$,  prove that the best prediction of $Y$ given $X = x$, which minimizes 
	\begin{align*}
	     E\left[  \big(Y - g(X) \big)^2 | X = x   \right],
	\end{align*}
	is $f(x) = E[Y| X = x].$
	\item 	Exercise 1.11
%	\item 	Exercise 1.16
\end{enumerate}


\textbf{Instructions:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item  Each question is worth 10 points. The total number of points is  $60$ equals $3\%$ of final grade.
	\item  To earn full credit you must show sufficient working and write clearly and legibly. Final answers will be worth only a few points. More points will be given to working and explanations, notations etc. 
	\item Where neccessary explain if your sampling technique is with or without replacement and if order matters or not.
	\item  You must specify the sample space and the probability measure clearly.
	\item Abbreviations/notations  used should be defined clearly
	\item State any formulae used and show all calculations
	
\end{itemize}
